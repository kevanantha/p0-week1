            <hr>
            <p>
                Our company started several years ago as a project that was initiated by two system engineers, who worked together as top freelancers, for many clients and who wanted at some point to take a step ahead into offering their knowledge, passion and experience, to a larger number of people. Their partnership soon led to working with an even larger number of clients and finally to founding the company Power Enterprises. Since then, the company's growth was so fast that soon we had to hire more personnel, create dedicated departments and offer more and more specialized services.
            </p>
        
            <h1 class="text-green"><span class="text-white">Our </span>Vision</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Our main focus points are quality, security and customer satisfaction and, at a higher level, we are happy to contribute to the exponential growth of the information technology and the internet. We left the customer satisfaction at last on purpose, because one of our goals is to help our customers learn that service quality and data security are very serious and important matters these days and strictly respecting those, may sometimes make some of our customers feel that some of their requests or desires are not respected. We do respect our customers and we are doing our best to provide documentation and howtos, so that everyone benefits of a stable, secure and easy to use hosting service.
